# P8105 Writing with Data code

I'm an R Markdown document!

### Section 1

Here's a **bold code chunk** that samples from an _italic normal distribution_:

```{r}
samp = rnorm(100)
length(samp)
```

### Section 2

I can take the mean of the sample, too!
The mean is `r mean(samp)`.





# R Markdown Auto start:

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
